# PyDS-Week-2-Word-Counter

This script reads a text file and then computes the number
of occurrences of each word in the file. The top ten words are then displayed.
There is optional functionality to read a second text file containing 
words that should be ignored when counting words from the primary file,
called "stopwords" in this context (e.g. dont count occurrences for "the", "a", etc.)
